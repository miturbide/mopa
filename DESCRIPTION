Description: Tools for transferable species distribution modeling and pseudo-absence 
    data generation allowing the straightforward design of relatively complex experiments 
    with multiple factors affecting the uncertainty (variability) of SDM outputs 
    (pseudo-absence sample, climate projection, modeling algorithm, etc.), and the 
    quantification of the contribution of different factors to the final variability 
    following the method described in Deque el al. (2010) <doi:10.1007/s00382-011-1053-x>. 
    Multiple methods for pseudo-absence data generation can be applied, including the novel 
    Three-step method as described in Iturbide et al. (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.05.018>.
    Additionally, a function for niche overlap calculation is provided, considering the metrics 
    described in Warren et al. (2008) <10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00482.x> and in
    Pianka (1973) <10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000413>.
